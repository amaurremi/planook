  "description": "Transfer tomatoes and their juices to the jar of a blender. Blend until tomatoes are coarsely chopped; set aside. \nIn a small skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add garlic and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 1 minute. Add tomato sauce and bring to a boil; season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes. \nGently crack eggs into tomato mixture, cover, and let cook 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, uncover, and let stand 2 to 3 minutes. \nTransfer each egg to a piece of toast. Spoon over sauce, garnish with cheese, and season with salt and pepper; serve immediately.",
