  "description": "In a small saucepan set over a medium heat, combine the oats, water, cashews, Liquid Aminos (or soy sauce), Sriracha, rosemary, and garlic. Bring it to a boil, cover, and lower the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed and the oats are cooked through, about 5 minutes.\nWhile the oats are cooking, heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over a medium heat. Once the oil is hot, crack in the eggs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook the eggs to your desired consistency, though sunny side up is my preference so the yolk can ooze all over your oatmeal. For sunny side up, cook the egg (without flipping) until the whites are set and the yolk is still jiggly, about 2 to 3 minutes.\nSpoon out the oatmeal, and top each serving with a fried egg. Drizzle a little bit of leftover oil from the egg pan over the plated oatmeal. Squirt additional Sriracha over all of it should you want a little extra heat. (And who doesnâ€™t?)"
