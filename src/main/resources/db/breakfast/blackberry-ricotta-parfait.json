  "description": "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until warm. Add the oats, and toast, stirring constantly for 3-4 minutes until they are aromatic and a bit darker in colour.\nIn a medium pot, combine the water and salt and bring to a boil. Add the toasted oats and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook, covered, for 12-15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed and the oats are tender. Add more water as needed. Remove from the heat and let stand for 10 minutes, covered. \nFor the ricotta mixture: In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, yogurt, maple syrup and mint together.\nFor the blackberries: Simply mash the berries roughly.\nTo assemble: For each serving bowl / glass, start with a layer of the ricotta mixture, follow with a layer of oats and a layer of blackberries. Repeat the layers once, and finish with a layer of ricotta. Top with fresh mint. Eat immediately or chill until ready to serve.",
