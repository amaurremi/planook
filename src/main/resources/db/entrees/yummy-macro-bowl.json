  "description": "For the bowl you can either eat the kale raw or lightly steam it. I steamed my mushroom for a few minutes.\nPlace the kale in a bowl. Next place the quinoa on one side.\nAdd the rest of the ingredients around the bowl in the order they appear on the list.\nEnjoy with chopsticks ;)\nIf you want to have a dressing for this I would suggest a miso or tahini type dressing, they would pair really well with all of the ingredients. Also, you can use any spouts for this, clover and broccoli would be great or beans, mung or adzuki.\nHave fun making your bowl and let me know how they turn out.",
